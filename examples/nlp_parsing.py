# doydl's Temporal Parsing & Normalization Engine — dately
#
# `dately` is a precision-first library for parsing, interpreting, and normalizing time expressions
# across both structured data and natural language. Built for developers and data teams working in
# time-sensitive domains, it delivers deterministic behavior, high-performance parsing, and
# transparent reasoning around temporal meaning.
#
# Designed for integration into NLP pipelines, ETL processes, scheduling engines, and cross-platform
# applications, `dately` supports everything from ISO formats and user-generated timestamps to
# phrases like “next Friday” or “Q2 2025.” Its symbolic parser bridges the gap between language and
# logic, enabling interpretable, testable, and production-grade handling of ambiguous or implicit
# time references.
#
# Features include format inference, batch-safe transformations, timezone normalization, and a
# modular architecture for composable workflows. Whether you're resolving date strings in a chatbot
# or aligning logs across systems, `dately` brings clarity, consistency, and control to temporal data.

import numpy as np

# Set variables
datestring = "2023-06-21"
datestring_list = [
    '2023-06-21', '2024-06-21', '2024-07-21', '2024-08-20',
    '2024-09-19', '2024-10-19', '2024-11-18', '2024-12-18',
    '2025-01-17', '2025-02-16', '2025-03-18', '2025-04-17'

## Natural Language Parsing (NLP)

# dately's new NLP engine allows you to interpret and resolve **free-text temporal expressions** into real calendar dates. It supports a wide range of grammar structures and handles expressions like:
# 
# * `"2nd Monday of next month"`
# * `"last 3 weekends"`
# * `"Q2 2026"`
# * `"5 days ago"`
# * `"middle of this year"`
# * `"next 6 weeks starting from March 15"`
# Behind the scenes, it uses rule-based grammars, temporal math, and context-aware resolution anchored to today's date (or a custom one you provide).



### Basic Usage
# Parse natural phrases into exact dates or date ranges
dtly.parse("first Monday of next month")

# → datetime.date(2024, 6, 3)
dtly.parse("last 5 weekends")
# → [(start_date_1, end_date_1), ..., (start_date_5, end_date_5)]


### Customizing Week Start
# Control which day is considered the start of the week (default = Sunday):
dtly.set_week_start("monday")  # affects “this week”, “last 3 weekends”, etc.
